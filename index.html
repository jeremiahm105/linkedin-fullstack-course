        <!-- //  ABOUT ME  // -->
        <main>
          <p> Greetings, I'm Jeremiah!
            I'm a Navy veteran who has charted a unique course from healthcare to the world of software development.
            With a graduate degree in healthcare and a background in serving our country,
            I've discovered a new and earnest passion for coding.
            Here's a little glimpse into who I am!
            Born and raised in the heart of the South,
            I carry with me the values of southern hospitality and a deep connection to the outdoors
            which many of my hobbies revolve around.
            In my free time, you can find me exploring the great outdoors,
            hiking or simply enjoying the peace and serenity of nature itself.

            After years of dedicated service in the Navy, I transitioned into the healthcare industry,
            where I acquired valuable skills in patient care and healthcare management.
            It was a fulfilling and honorable path, but life had more surprises in store for me.
            Through a twist of fate, I found my true calling in the dynamic world of web development.
            This transition has opened up a world of creativity,
            problem-solving, and innovation that I now find deeply satisfying.

            My academic journey led me to a graduate degree in healthcare,
            equipping me with a special blend of analytical and critical thinking skills
            that have proven invaluable in the tech world.
            My background in healthcare has instilled a strong sense of empathy and attention to detail,
            qualities I now bring to my coding projects.
            <br><br>
            Overall,
            I'm excited
            to bring this unique combination of experiences and perspectives to the web development community,
            where I continue to learn, grow, and create meaningful solutions.</p>
